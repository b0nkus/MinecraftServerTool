This is my first big project, so if this program helped you I would very much appreciate you starring the repository to get it more attention. If you have any problems, submit an issue in the issue tab on the GitHub repo. If you have a suggestion, I would love to hear it in the discussions tab in the Suggestions & Ideas section. Thanks for reading, and I hope this helps your Minecraft servers.

**If you get confused on how to use it, check the GitHub wiki for instructions.**

### Disclaimers

If you are on linux, you need xterm or a terminal emulator that can be used by passing the command xterm to start servers.
