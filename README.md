## Features
Easy Server Start
- Select start a server, select the server, and your done.

Support for Tunneling Software
- Allows you to instantly start tunneling software while using easy server start if you can't port forward. (Built with ngrok and playit.gg in mind)

Easy Server Setup - *PLANNED*
- This will allow you to make any server easily by selecting Minecraft version, forge fabric or vanilla, and the versions of those that you want.

Graphical Interface - *POSSIBILITY*
- Instead of having the plain terminal interface, I could possibly create a nicer looking graphical interface that will be more user friendly. This seems very far out though if possible.

## Disclaimers
- Windows is the targeted operating system for this program, but you could most likely get it to work on Mac or Linux through Wine. If you want native support, create an issue in the Issues tab on this repository and let me know!
- Bedrock servers are currently not supported by any tunnelers that don't work by just opening them like Ngrok. Ngrok is specifically set to open 25565 currently, so use PlayIt.gg if you need a tunneler and you play on Bedrock.
