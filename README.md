## Features
Easy Server Start
- Select start a server, select the server, and your done.

Support for Tunneling Software
- Allows you to instantly start tunneling software while using easy server start if you can't port forward. (Built with ngrok and playit.gg in mind)

Easy Server Setup - *PLANNED*
- This will allow you to make any server easily by selecting Minecraft version, forge fabric or vanilla, and the versions of those that you want.

Graphical Interface - *PLANNED*
- Instead of having the plain terminal interface, we could have a nicer looking graphical interface that will be more user friendly.

## Disclaimers
- Linux support is not available yet, but I am working on it. All I have to do is change how some things work and then figure out how to compile it all together.
- Bedrock servers are currently not supported by any tunnelers that don't work by just opening them like Ngrok. Ngrok is specifically set to open 25565 currently, so use PlayIt.gg if you need a tunneler and you play on Bedrock.
